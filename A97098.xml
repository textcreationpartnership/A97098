            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Fom my ſerious and frequent conſideration of the goodneſſe of God towards man, the innumerable good things he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his ſuſtenance &amp; comfort; that he hath made him of ſo large a capacity as to be Lord over other creatures; ever teſtifying his love, by giving rain and fruitfull ſeaſons, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our hearts with food and gladneſſe: That he hath made him, as his own Vicegerent, to ſee all things juſtly and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, and planted in him an ever living conſcience to mind him continually of his duty; I could not but wonder that this ſhould not be ſufficient to keep mankind in order, and the world in quiet.</p>
            <p>But when I conſidered the infinite obligations of love and thankfulneſſe, wherewith men, as Chriſtians, are bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd unto God, and yet how extremely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe all ſorts of Chriſtians were, to the eſſentiall and practicall part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo great ingratitude did quite aſtoniſh me.</p>
            <p>And made me with much patience paſſe over the many injuries I have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for my own endeavours after common good; and to reſolve within my ſelf, that for any man to give good heed to the voyce of God in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and vigorouſly to appear againſt the unrighteouſneſſe of men, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the way to affliction and reproaches.</p>
            <p>And hereupon, when of late I have been hunted with open mouth, and could appear in no place, but I was pointed at, and frown'd upon almoſt by every man, I was but little moved; for why ſhould I expect better meaſure then my Maker and Redeemer? And ſo with patience ſate me down, and conſidered, whence ſo many undeſerved aſperſions ſhould proceed againſt me at a time too, when I was moſt ſecure; all power being then in the hands of ſuch, from whom I had merited nothing but love and friendſhip.</p>
            <p>I was ſure any man that had a mind to know what, or where I was, might eaſily trace me from my preſent habitation in <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> to <hi>Newland</hi> in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> where I was born of no unknown or beggarly parentage, as ſome have ſuggeſted to diſparage me; but ſuch as were both generous, as the world accounts; and ingenuous too, as wiſe men judge; and to whoſe exemplary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue I owe more, then for my being.</p>
            <p>I knew an exact accompt might be taken of me, in leſſe then one daies time: and that this may gain belief, I ſhall refer the enquiry of my birth and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116145:3"/> breeding to Mr <hi>Sallaway,</hi> a Member of Parliament for the County of <hi>Worce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and for my firſt eight years in <hi>London</hi> to Mr <hi>Crowder,</hi> another Member of the preſent Parliament: The truth of whoſe relation, I ſuppoſe none will doubt, and I ſhall be obliged to them, to ſatisfie as many as deſire it.</p>
            <p>For 15 years together, after that, I dwelt in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>James,</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hill, <hi>London:</hi> Where, for all that time, any that pleaſe, may be ſatisfied; ſince which time, I have lived in <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> where now my Wiſe and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are; and what my demeanour there hath been, my neighbours will ſoon reſolve.</p>
            <p>I have been married 21 years, and have had almoſt 20 Children; my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion hath been Merchandiſing, but never was beyond the Seas; but my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died in <hi>Flanders</hi> in my imployment, and coſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me near 50 pounds, rather then he ſhould want that buriall accuſtomed to Proteſtants; which one would think might ſuffice to prove me no Jeſuite.</p>
            <p>In all which time, I believe ſcarce any that ever knew me, will be ſo diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geruous as to ſpot me with any vice; and as little of infirmity as of any other; having never heard ill of my ſelf, untill my hopes of this Parliament encouraged me to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gage in publique affairs; being then 40 years of age, 20 of which I had been a ſerious and ſtudious reader and obſerver of things neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But then in ſhort time, I heard ſuch vile unworthy things as I abhorred, and made me bluſh to hear; and ever ſince, reproaches have purſued me, like rowling waves, one in the neck of another.</p>
            <p>All which being groundleſſe, as my conſcience well knew, I ſoon concluded, they were deviſed purpoſely by ſome Politicians (whoſe corrupt intereſt I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) to render me odious to all ſocieties of men, and ſo to make me uſeleſſe to the Common wealth, which my long experience and obſervation told me, was a common practice in all ages.</p>
            <p>So as to me it is evident, that corrupt intereſts are the originall of Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; for a juſt courſe of life, or intereſt, needs no crafts or policies to ſupport it: And it is as clear to me, that Politicians are the originall of reproaches, and the fountain of ſlander: for that it being impoſſible to deſend an ill cauſe by reaſon; reproaches neceſſarily muſt be deviſed, and caſt upon the oppoſers to diſcredit what they ſpeak; or it were impoſſible for any corrupt intereſt to ſtand the leaſt blaſt of a rationall oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Moſt miſerable unhappy therfore are thoſe men, who are engaged and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to continue in any kind of corrupt intereſt, or way of living; ſince they are thereby all their life long neceſſitated to become meer Politicians, deviſers of lies, ſlanders, falſhoods, and many times to perpetrate the moſt honeſt civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that can be imagined, for ſupportation of their intereſt.</p>
            <p>And upon this accompt I am certain, and upon no other, ſo much dirt hath been caſt upon me; for when art and ſophiſtry will not ſeem to vanquiſh truth and reaſon, aſperrion generally wil do the deed.</p>
            <p>Which hath made diſcreet and conſiderable men to make a contrary uſe of aſperſions: For whereas the raſh, and weak, when they hear either man or Cauſe aſperſt, they preſently ſhun the men, and abhominate the cauſe upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no examination, as being affrighted therewith. Wiſe and diſcreet men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kilfull in the common rules and practiſes of the world, and ſo far from prejud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116145:3"/> either the man or cauſe of evil; that without prejudging, or partiality, they make an exact enquiry, how things are, and determine nothing but upon good and reall ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And there is good cauſe for every man ſo to do; for if all ſtories be well ſearcht into, it will be found, That unjuſt, cruel, covetous, or ambitious men, ſuch as were engaged in corrupt intereſts, or in ſome wicked deſigns, were ever the aſperſers; and honeſt, juſt and publique ſpirited men the aſperſed.</p>
            <p>That this is a certain truth, examples need not be brought out of common hiſtories, whilſt the Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ptures abound therewith.</p>
            <p>It was the portion both of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and of all the holy men of all times: yea, our bleſſed Saviour, who ſpent all his time on earth in <hi>doing good,</hi> was nevertheleſſe tearmed, <hi>a Wine-bibber, a Friend of Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a Caſter out of Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.</hi> And who were they that ſo aſperſt him, but the great and learned Politicians of the times, who with the Scribes and Phariſees, ſet themſelves againſt him and his doctrines, becauſe he gave knowledge to the poor and ſimple; by which, their deluſion, pride, oppreſſion and corrupt intereſts were plainly diſcovered.</p>
            <p>So that let no man look to eſcape aſperſions, that ſets himſelf to promote any publique good, or to remove any old or new ſetled evil; but let him reſolve, according to the good he endeavoureth, ſo ſhall his aſperſion be: Nor let him thinke, when time and his conſtant actings have worn out, one, or two, or ten aſperſions, that he is therfore free; but if he continue to mind more good, he ſhall be ſure to find new aſperſions, ſuch as he never dream'd of, or could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> oppoſeth the deluſions and oppreſſions of the Pope, and his Clergy, and the ruine of Emperours, Kings and great ones of the world, laies them all open and naked to the view of all men: and who was ever more aſperſt then he?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> ſets forth a Treatiſe, entituled, <hi>The vanity of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi> and is reputed a Conjurer for his labour.</p>
            <p>How falſly and vilely were our Martyrs reproached and cruelly uſed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, for oppoſing the wickedneſſe of the great ones of that time? And how unjuſtly Mr <hi>Geeenwood,</hi> Mr <hi>Penry,</hi> and Mr <hi>Barrow</hi> ſuffered in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> daies for publiſhing unwelcome truths, is yet ſadly remembred.</p>
            <p>Yet how odious did the Biſhops ſet forth thoſe that pretended for the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Preſbyterie? all along comparing them to the Anabaptiſts of <hi>Munſter;</hi> affirming, that (whatever they pretended) they aimed to deſtroy all Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Government; to have plurality of mines, and all things common; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of them to render them odious to the people.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Court reproached Parliaments upon their leaſt ſhew of redreſſe of grievances, or abatement of Prerogative; calling them, a factious, ſedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And even ſo divers Preſbyters of late have dealt with the Independents, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, and the like; ſtiling them Heretiques, Blaſphemers, Sectaries; and compared the Army and their Leaders to <hi>Jack Cade, Wat Tyler,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leydon.</hi>

            <p>And certainly there was never ſo fair an opportunity to free this Nation from all kinds of oppreſſion and uſurpation as now, if ſome had hearts to do their endeavour, that ſtrongly pretended to do their utmoſt; and what hinders, is as yet, ſomewhat in a miſtery; but time will reveal all, and then it will appear more particularly then will yet be permitted to be diſcovered, from what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fountaine, (though ſweetned with flowers of Religion) theſe undeſerved clamours have iſſued againſt me and my friends.</p>
            <p>But I ſhame to thinke how readily, the moſt irrationall ſenceleſſe aſperſions caſt upon me, are credited by many, whom I eſteemed ſincere in their way of Religion, and that moſt uncharitably againſt the long experience they have had of me, and moſt unthankfully too, againſt the many ſervices I have done them, in ſtanding for their liberties (and animating others ſo to do) when they were moſt in danger and moſt expoſed, never yet failing though in my own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar I were not then concerned) to manifeſt as great a tenderneſſe of their welfare as mine owne.</p>
            <p>But in patience I poſſeſſe my ſelf; ſuch as the tree is ſuch I perceive will be the fruit: and as I ſee a man is no farther a man then as he <hi>clearly</hi> underſtands, ſo alſo I perceive a Chriſtian is no farther a Chriſtian then as he ſtands clear from errour, and ſuperſtition, with both which were not moſt men extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tainted? ſuch raſh and hariſh cenſures could never have paſt upon me, ſuch evil fruits ſpringing not from true Religion; wherein, as full of zeal, as the times ſeeme to be, moſt men are far to ſeek: every man almoſt differs from his neighbour, yet every man is confident, who then is right in judgement? and if the judgement direct to practice (as no doubt it ought) no marvell we ſee ſo much weakneſſe, ſo much emptineſſe, vanity, and to ſpeak ſoftly, ſo much <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity,</hi> ſo many meer Nationall and verball, ſo few practicall and reall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but buſie-bodies, tale bearers, ſerviceable, not to God, in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the life or good name of their neighbours, but unto polititians in blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defaming, and ſo in ruining of their brother.</p>
            <p>If I now amidſt ſo great variety of judgements and practiſes as there are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould go a particular way; Charity and Chriſtianity would forbear to cenſure me of evill, and would give me leave to follow mine owne underſtanding of the Scriptures, even as I freely allow unto others.</p>

            <p>But when <hi>I</hi> conſider the ſmall thanks and ill rewards <hi>I</hi> had from ſome of Mr. <hi>Edward's</hi> his oppoſers, upon my publiſhing thoſe Treatiſes, <hi>I</hi> have cauſe to beleive they are fraught with ſome ſuch unuſuall truths, that have ſpoiled the markets of ſome of the more refined <hi>Demetrius's</hi> and craftſ-men; <hi>I</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe <hi>I</hi> have been very apt, to blunt out ſuch truths as I had well digeſted to be needfull amongſt men: wherein my conſcience is much delighted, not much regarding the diſpleaſure of any, whilſt <hi>I</hi> but performe my duty.</p>
            <p>And in all that <hi>I</hi> have written my judgement concerning Civil Government is ſo evident, as (if men were men indeed, and were not altogether devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elling, then that Petition importeth; the burners thereof, and the then aſperſers of me and my friends having been ſince taught a new leſſon, and which might be a good warning to thoſe that now a freſh take liberty to abuſe us: but no heart ſwoln with pride as the politicians, nor ſo ſcornes advice, ſpurns and jeers, and laugh at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet for all their confidence, few of them eſcape the ſevere hand of Gods juſtice firſt and laſt, even in this world.</p>
            <p>Indeed it hath been no difficult thing to know my judgement by the ſcope of that Petition, and truely were I as deadly an enemy unto Parliaments (as I have been and ſtill am a moſt affectionate devotant to their juſt Authority) I could not wiſh them a greater miſchief then to be drawne to uſe Petitioners unkindly, or to deny them things reaſonable, upon ſuſpition that they would be emboldened to aſk things unreaſonable, by which rule, no juſt things ſhould ever be granted; wiſhing with all my heart that care may be ſpeedily taken in this particular, the people already being too much enclined to be out of love with Parliaments, then which I know no greater evill can befall the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>Another new thing I am aſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t withall, is, that I hold Polygamie, that is, that it is lawfull to have more wives then one; (I wonder what will be next, for theſe will wear out, or returne to the right owners) and this ſcandall would intimate that I am addicted looſely to women; but this is another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed arrow drawne from the ſame Pollitick quiver, and ſhot without any regard to my inclination; and ſhewes the authors to be empty of all goodneſſe, and filled with a moſt wretchleſſe malice; for this is ſuch a ſlander as doggs me at the heels home to my houſe; ſeeking to torment me even with my wife and children, and ſo to make my life a burthen unto me; but this alſo loſeth its force, and availeth nothing, as the reſt do alſo, where I am fully known; nay it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth

            <p>There are alſo that give out that I am of a bloudy diſpoſition, its very ſtrange it ſhould be ſo and I not know it, ſure I am, and I bleſſe God for it, that ſince I was a youth I never ſtruck any one a blow through quarrell or paſſion; avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with greateſt care all occaſions and provocation; and although poſſibly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would prevaile with me to kill rather then be killed; yet to my judgement and conſcience, to kill a man is ſo horrid a thing, that upon deliberation I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſolve I ſhould do it.</p>
            <p>And though to free a Nation from bondage and tyranny it may be lawfull to kill and ſlay, yet I judge it ſhould not be attempted but after all means uſed for prevention; (<hi>wherein I fear there hath been ſome defect</hi>) and upon extreme neceſſity, and then alſo with ſo diſmall a ſadneſſe, exempt from that uſuall vapouring and gallantry (accuſtomed in meer mercinary Souldiers) as ſhould teſtifie to the world that their hearts took no pleaſure therein; much leſſe that they look't for particular gaine and profit for their ſo doing: and I wiſh thoſe who have defamed me in this, did not by their garniſht outſide, demonſtrate that they have found a more pleaſing ſweetneſſe in bloud then ever I did.</p>
            <p>Now ſome may wonder why thoſe religious people that ſo readily ſeem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as men are more or leſſe ſuperſtitious, the effects will be found amongſt them; nor is better to be expected from them untill they deeme themſelves, no further Religious, then as they find brotherly love abound in their hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Adjutant Generall immediately followed my maid into my Chamber, as I was putting on my clothes; telling me, that he was ſent by the Councel of State (an Authority which he did own) to bring me before them: I aſkt, for what cauſe? he anſwered me, he did not underſtand particularly, but in the notion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Souldiers I perceived very loud in the garden, and I not imagining then, there had been more diſperſt in my neighbours grounds and houſes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to preſerve my credit (a thing ſooner bruiſed then made whole) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him, to cauſe their ſilence, which he courteouſly did: Then I told him, if he had known me in any meaſure, he would have thought himſelf, without any ſouldiers, ſufficient to bring me before them: That I could nor but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (conſidering how well I was known) that I ſhould be ſent for by Souldiers, when there was not the meaneſt civil Officer but might command my appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116145:8"/> That I thought it was a thing not agreeable to that freedom and liberty which had been pretended.</p>
            <p>That now he ſaw what I was, I ſhould take it as a favour, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Souldiers off, which he did very friendly, reſerving ſome two very civil Gentlemen with him; ſo being ready, he ſhewed m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Warrant: the ſubſtance whereof was, for ſuſpicion of treaſon, in being ſuſpected to be the Author of a Book, entituled, <hi>The ſecond part of Englands new Chains diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I deſired him to take a Copy of it, which was denied, though then and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by my ſelf, and Lieut. Col. <hi>John Lilburn</hi> (who was likewiſe in the ſame Warrant) importuned very much for.</p>
            <p>Then I went out with him into Moor-Fields, and there I ſaw, to my great wonder, a great party of ſouldiers, which he commanded to march before, and went with me, (only with another Gentleman, at a great diſtance) to <hi>Pauls;</hi> yet ſuch people as were up, took ſo much notice of it, as it flew quickly all about the Town; which I knew would redound much to my prejudice, in my credit; which was my only care, the times being not quallified for recovery of bruiſes in that kind.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard was their rendezvous; where I was no ſooner come, but I eſpied my Friends, Mr <hi>Lilburn</hi> and Mr <hi>Prince,</hi> both labouring to convince the ſouldiers of the injury done unto us, and to themſelves, and to poſterity, and the Nation in us in that they, as ſouldiers, would obey and execute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in ſeizing any Freeman of <hi>England,</hi> not Members of the Army, before they evidently ſaw the civil Magiſtrates and Officers in the Common-wealth, were reſiſted by force, and not able to bring men to legall trials, with very much to that purpoſe; and in my judgment, prevailed very much amongſt them; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny looking, as if they repented and grieved to ſee ſuch dealings.</p>
            <p>Then they removed to a houſe for refreſhment, where, after a little diſcourſe, we perſwaded them to releaſe two of Mr <hi>Daveniſh</hi> his ſons, whom a Captain had taken into cuſtody without Warrant: but that kind of errour being laid fully open, they were enlarged with much civility, which I was glad to ſee, as perceiving no inclination in the preſent Officers or Souldiers, to defend any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant proceedings, when this underſtood them to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>So the Adjutant Generall ſent off the whole party, and with ſome very few, took us, by water, to his Quarters at <hi>Whitehall</hi> (where after a while, came in Mr <hi>Overton</hi>) the Adjutant intending about nine of the clock, to go with us to <hi>Darby</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>But the Councel not ſitting till five at night, we were kept in his Quarters all that time; where ſome, but not many of our friends that came to viſit us, were permitted.</p>
            <p>About five a clock, the Councel ſate; ſo he took us thither, where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued about two houres, before any of us were called in; and then Mr <hi>Lilburn</hi> was called, and was there about a quarter of an hour, and then came out to us, and his Friends, declaring at large all that had paſt between him and them.</p>
            <p>Then after a little while, I was called in, and directed up to Sergeant <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi> the Preſident; who told me, that the Parliament had taken notice of a very dangerous Book, full of ſedition and treaſon: and that the Councel was informed, that I had a hand in the making or compiling thereof; that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116145:8"/> had referred the enquiry and ſearch after the Authors and Publiſhers, to that Councel; and that I ſhould hear the Order of Parliament read, for my better ſatisfaction: ſo the Order was read, containing the ſubſtance of what the Preſident had delivered; and then he ſaid, by this you underſtand the cauſe wherfore you are brought hither; and then was ſilent, expecting, as I thought, what I would ſay.</p>
            <p>But the matter which had been ſpoken, being only a relation, I kept ſilence, expecting what further was intended; which being perceived, the Preſident ſaid, You are free to ſpeak, if you have any thing to ſay to it: to which I ſaid only this, I do not know why I am ſuſpected: Is that all, ſaid he: To which I anſwered, Yes; and then he ſaid, You may withdraw: So I went forth.</p>
            <p>And then Mr <hi>Overton,</hi> and after him, Mr <hi>Prince,</hi> were called in; and after all four had been out a while, Mr <hi>Lilburn</hi> was called in again, and put forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way; and then I was called in again:</p>
            <p>And the Preſident ſaid to this effect, that the Parliament had repoſed a great truſt in them for finding out the Authors of that Book; and that the Councel were carefull to give a good accompt of their truſt; in order whereunto, I had been called in, and what I had ſaid, they had conſidered; but they had now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to aſk me a queſtion, which was this: Whether or no I had any hand in the making or compiling of this Book? holding the Book in his hand: To which, after a little while, I anſwered to this effect, That I could not but very much wonder to be aſked ſuch a queſtion; howſoever, that it was very much againſt my judgment and conſcience, to anſwer to queſtions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which concern'd my ſelf; that if I ſhould anſwer to it, I ſhould not only betray my own liberty, but the liberties of all Engliſh-men, which I could not do with a good conſcience: And that I could not but exceedingly grieve at the dealing I had found that day; that being one who had been alwaies ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Parliament, and ſo well known to moſt of the Gentlemen there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that nevertheleſſe I ſhould be ſent for with a party of horſe and foot, to the affrighting of my family, and ruine of my credit; and that I could not be ſatisfied, but that it was very hard meaſure to be uſed thus upon ſuſpicion only; profeſſing, that if they did hold me under reſtraint from following my buſineſſe and occaſions, it might be my undoing, which I intreated might be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Then the Preſident ſaid, I was to anſwer the queſtion; and that they did not aſk it, as in way of triall, ſo as to proceed in judgment thereupon, but to report it to the Houſe: To which I ſaid, that I had anſwered it ſo as I could with a good conſcience, and could make no other anſwer; ſo I was put forth a back way, as Mr <hi>Lilburn</hi> had been, and where he was.</p>
            <p>After this, they cal'd in Mr <hi>Overton,</hi> and after him Mr <hi>Prince,</hi> uſing the very ſame expreſſions, and queſtion to all alike; and ſo we were all four together; and after a long expectance, we found we were committed Priſoners to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> for ſuſpicion of high treaſon; where now we are, to the great rejoycing of all that hate us, whoſe longing deſires are ſo far ſatisfied: And to make good that face of danger, which by ſending ſo many horſe and ſoot was put upon it, a ſtrong Guard hath ever ſince been continued at <hi>Darby</hi> houſe, when the Councel ſits.</p>

Beſides, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the conſequence of our Sufferings, for in like manner, any man or woman in <hi>England</hi> is liable to be fetcht from the fartheſt parts of the Land, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of horſe and foot, in an hoſtile manner, to the affrighting and ruining of their Families; and for a thing, or act, never known before by any law to be a crime, but voted to be ſo, only the very day perhaps of ſigning the Warrant: And therfore that ſuch power can be in this, or any other Parliament; or that ſuch a kind of proceeding can be conſiſtent with freedom, I wiſh any would give me a reaſon that I might underſtand it; for certainly the meer voting of it, will hardly give ſatisfaction: And now I well perceive, they had good ground for it, who aſſerted this belief into the firſt Agreement of the people; namely,</p>

               <hi>That as the laws ought to be equall, ſo they muſt be good, and not evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our liberties;</hi> and I wiſh that might be well conſidered in making of any Law: And likewiſe, That no Law might be concluded, before it be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for a competent time; that thoſe who are ſo minded, might offer their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons either for or againſt the ſame, as they ſee cauſe: But I forget my ſelf, not conſidering that my propoſing of this, will be a means to beget a diſlike there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and may poſſibly work me ſome new aſperſions.</p>
            <p>I am ſaid likewiſe to have worſe opinions then this; whereof one is, That I hope to ſee this Nation governed by reaſon, and not by the ſword.</p>
            <p>Nay worſe yet; That notwithſtanding all our preſent diſtractions, there is a poſſibility upon a clear and free debate of things, to diſcover ſo equall, juſt and rationall Propoſitions, as ſhould produce ſo contentfull ſatisfaction, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute peace, proſperity and reſt to this Nation; as that there ſhould be no ſear of man, nor need of an Army; or at worſt, but a very ſmall one.</p>
            <p>But if I ſhould declare my mind in this more fully, it would, as other good motions and propoſitions of mine have done, beget me the opinion of a very dangerous man, and ſome new aſperſion; there being ſome, whoſe intereſt muſt not ſuffer it to be believed.</p>
            <p>And yet it may be true enough; for I could inſtance a Country, not ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Seas as ours is, nor ſo defenſible from Enemies, but that is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with potent Princes and States, and was as much diſtracted with diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ours at preſent is, yet by wiſdom ſo order themſelves, as that they keep up no Army, nor dread no war, but have ſet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But as ſubject as ſome would make me to vain opinions, there is one that hath been creeping upon us about eight months, which yet gets no hold upon me; and that is, That the preſent power of the Sword may reign; from this ground, that the power which is uppermoſt is the power of God; and the power of the Sword being now (as ſome reaſon) above the civil Authority, it is therfore the power of God: But the greateſt wonder in this, is, that ſome Anabaptiſts who are deſcended from a people ſo far from this opinion, that they abhorred the uſe of the ſword, though in their own deſence (to ſuch extremities are people ſubject to, that think themſelves to have all knowledge and religion in them, when in truth it is but imagination and Scripture) As for me, I am of neither of theſe opinions, but ſhould be glad once again to ſee the ſword in its right place, in all ſenſes; and the civil Authority to mind as well the eſſence as the punctilio's and formalities, but neglecting neither; and that the People would be ſo far carefull of their own good, as to obſerve with a watchfull eie, the right ordering and diſpoſing both of the civill and military power; we having no watrant to argue that to be of God, but what is juſtly derived, attained and uſed to honeſt means; the ends, I mean, of all Government, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſafety, peace, freedom and proſperity of the people governed; whereas otherwiſe, Tyrants, Theeves, our-laws, Pirats and Murthere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But why ſpend I my time thus, in clearing mens underſtandings, that ſo they might be able to preſerve themſelves from bondage and miſery, being ſo ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited for my labour?

            <p>Only one aſperſion remains, which I thought good to quit here; which is, that I am a Pentioner to ſome forraign State; which indeed is moſt falle, and is invented for the end, as all the reſt are, to make me odious: And truly if men were not grown paſt all ſhame, or care of what they ſaid or heard of me, it would be impoſſible to get belief; for which way doth it appear? I think, nay am ſure, that in my houſe no man (bred in that plenty I was) ever contented himſelf with leſſe, which is eaſily known—and for the apparell of my ſelf, my Wife and Children, if it exceed in any thing, it is in the plaineſſe, where with we are very well ſatisfied; and ſo in houſhold ſtuff, and all other expenſes; and for my charge upon publique, voluntary occaſions, I rather merit a charitable conſtruction from thoſe I have accompanied with, then any thanks or praiſe for any extraordinary diſburſments: and I am ſure I go on ſoot many times from my houſe to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> when as I ſee many inferiour to me in birth and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, only the favorites of the times, on their ſtately horſes, and in their coaches; and when I have been amongſt my Friends in the Army, as many times I have had occaſion, I muſt ever acknowledge, that I have received amongſt them ten kindneſſes for one; and yet (not to wrong my ſelf) I think, nay am ſure, there is not a man in the world that is of a more free or thankfull heart; and have nothing elſe to bear me up againſt what good and worthy men (whom I have ſeen in great neceſſities) might conjecture of me, when as I have admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred nothing to relieve them—when was the time, and where the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I gave dinners or ſuppers, or other gifts? For ſhame, thou black-mouth'd ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hide thy head, till the light of theſe knowing times be out; all that thou canſt do, is not ſufficient to blaſt me amongſt thoſe with whom I converſe, or who have experience of my conſtancy in affection &amp; endeavour to the generall good of all men, but to thy greater torment &amp; vexation, know this, they that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely love me for the ſame, are exceedingly increaſed, and many whom thou hadſt deceived, return daily, manifeſting their greater love to me and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, as willing to recompence the loſſe of that time thou deceivedſt them.</p>
            <p>And this impriſonment, which thou haſt procured me, for my greater and irrecoverable reproach amongſt good men; thy poyſon'd heart would burſt to ſee how it hath wrought the contrary, ſo far, as I never had ſo clear a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love and approbation in my life, from ſincere ſingle-hearted people, as now to my exceeding joy I find.</p>
            <p>And poſſibly for time to come, theſe notorious falſhoods with which the ſlanderous tongue hath purſued me, may have the ſame effect upon theſe weak people thou makeſt thy inſtruments, which they have had upon me; and that is, That I am the moſt backward to receive a report concerning any mans repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to his prejudice, of any man in the world, and account it a baſeneſſe to pry into mens actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to liſten to mens diſcourſes, or to report what I judge they would not have known, as not beſeeming a man of good and honeſt bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or that underſtands what belongs to civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>But leaving theſe things, which I wiſh I had had no occaſion to inſiſt upon, it will concern me to conſider the condition I am in; for though I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of crime or guilt in my ſelf, worthy my care, yet conſidering how, and in

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116145:14"/> my Friends have preſented, had been granted, it had been much better with the Common-wealth then now it is; for we have been ever watchfull for the good of <hi>England,</hi> though now we are requited with a priſon and aſperſions for our labour: and if the preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> time ſhould be ſo froward as to reject the lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> we bring, yet our comfort is, that our principles are of a growing nature, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the power of truth in them: ſo that we cannot doubt, but <hi>England</hi> will be the better for our motions and endeavours to all generations.</p>
            <p>I little thought when I began this work, that it would have drawn me out to ſuch a length, much beyond my diſpoſition; but if I can avoid it, I ſhall make amends, and never trouble the world any more in this kind: Nor had I done thus much, but that through my eaſily pierced ſides, they wounded the cauſe, I ſhall promote whil'ſt I have breath; they wound the reputation of the Family whereof I am; and may too much wound with grief my dear and ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I have the greateſt cauſe to love; my Wife and Children alſo are deeply wounded in my reproaches, whom I value ten-fold above my life; and upon whom, whenſoever I ſhall leave the world, I would leave no blemiſh: Nor ſhould I, could my heart be truly underſtood; for how exceedingly ſhort ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I may come of doing my duty in all caſes, yet are my deſires, inclinations, and intentions, as reall to the publique, as free from baſeneſſe in my particular walkings and occaſions; as the corrupt <hi>Fountain of Slander</hi> is full of malice, treachery and impudence.</p>
            <p>Nor could I, as the caſe is now with me (this reſtraint being very much to my prejudice) bear up my ſpirit with that contentedneſſe, I bleſſe God, I do; were it not for the integrity of my Conſcience towards all men: And whereas long ſince I had concluded it for a moſt excellent truth, my experience now tels me, that affliction is ten thouſand times better then ſin; and that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent have more chearfulneſſe in a Dungeon, then corrupt and wicked men have, though they are cloathed in Purple, and fare deliciouſly every day.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe being thus far furniſhed immediately after I came into priſon, I did forbear to print it, becauſe of its largeneſſe, far exceeding my inclination; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thereupon began to take ſome more content, that I had not publiſhed this Diſcourſe: When lo, on a ſudden, juſt as I was to be made a cloſe Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there belches out from the corrupt <hi>Fountain of Slander,</hi> ſuch a foggy miſt of lies, invectives and ſlanders, as would have choa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But, I bleſſe God, I am proof againſt it, I have a certain antidote they are not
